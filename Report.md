These benchmarks provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the performance of LLMs across various dimensions, including reasoning, knowledge, and code generation. DeepSeek R1's performance on these benchmarks highlights its advancements compared to previous models.

## 3. Methodology

DeepSeek R1 employs a novel training approach that combines reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The methodology can be broken down into the following stages:

1.  **DeepSeek-R1-Zero:** This stage involves applying RL directly to the base model without any prior SFT. This approach allows the model to develop reasoning capabilities through self-evolution, demonstrating the potential of pure RL in enhancing LLMs. The model uses GRPO as the RL framework to improve reasoning.
2.  **DeepSeek-R1:** This stage builds upon the base model with a small amount of cold-start data. The pipeline includes two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the modelâ€™s reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.
3.  **Distillation:** The reasoning patterns of the large DeepSeek-R1 model are distilled into smaller models. This process involves fine-tuning smaller, dense models using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1.

This multi-stage approach allows DeepSeek R1 to achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining RL and SFT techniques. The use of distillation further enables the creation of smaller, more efficient models without significant performance loss.
